# you create a local copy of the remote repository 
git clone <repository address>

# you create a new file, "index.html"

# You check the status of the repository, it tells you that there is one untracked file
git status

# You start tracking a specific file
git add index.html  
# or start tracking all file
git add . 

# Checking again the status tells you that there is a file to commit
git status

# We commit the file to our local repository, adding the proper message (-m)
git commit -am "Initial commit"  
-without -m it will prompt the default text editor
-without -a it will commit only the file tracked. Remember, if you don't use this option, you have to add the files every time they are modified. 

# To push the changes in our local repository to the remote server
git push <repository> <branch>

Since  we are in a team, at some point, other users will make changes and we'll need to pull them

# pull changes from the remote repository
git pull

Branching
 # to create a branch locally
git branch <branch name>

# to create the branch in the remote repository, after you have created it locally
git push origin <branch name>
 
 # to change a branch
git checkout <branch name>
 
# to merge the branch1 in branch 2
git checkout <branch1>
git merge <branch2>

# to delete a branch 
git branch -d <branch name>
